# Simple-Bookmark---Firefox-extention
Just some simple extensions that works just as a bookmark.


You can install unsigned extensions as normal add-ons into other versions of Firefox (e.g. Firefox Developer Edition, Firefox Nightly, Unbranded Beta, or Unbranded Release) by setting xpinstall.signatures.required to false in about:config. 

Also, click the settingsicon on the add-ons and themes page, and choose Install Add-on From File...
